/* Fish EXTENDS Animal. So what?

 First of all, this is a primary example of INHERITANCE (one of the 4 pillars of OOP)
 This means that the Fish Class has ALL the members of the Animal Class (they were inherited)
 BUT it can also have its own members unique to Fish
 Fish is therefore a CHILD class of Animal AKA Subclass
